## Details

### We used a sample size = 10000, instead of all data, to make our program run quicker. Since the datasets are too large, and take a very long time to download.

### Outcome
1. Number of rides of three airports are: # of rides of LGA > # of rides of JFK > # of rides of EWR
2. Number of ordered trips vary according to hour each day. Midnight (4AM-5AM) reaches the lowest number and evening(7PM-8PM) reaches the highest number.
3. Average distance in each month varies according to month. January reaches the highest, and February reaches the lowest.
